# monte-carlo-simulations

This is a collection of my work completed during my time as an undergraduate researcher under the NYU Computational Physical Chemistry SURF, Summer 2024. My primary project focused on event chain Monte Carlo methods and applications of factor fields to accelerate equilibrium mixing times. 

Much of this work followed Event-chain Monte Carlo with Factor Fields (insert link and citation here), and uses background, implementation, and metrics as the foundation.
